In this project we took a dataset of crimes in chicago, with data such as: kind of crime, time the crime happened, Whether the criminal was arrested or not, location of the crime.

We used 4 different methods such as adaboost, svm, knn, logistic regression.

Given details of a crime committed ,We tried to predict 3 questions:Will the criminal be arrested ,Will the crime happen day or night,at what location was the crime committed.
We showed the success rates of the prediction.
